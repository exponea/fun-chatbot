# Joana the Chatbot

BusinessInsider has publsihed [an article](http://www.businessinsider.com/chatbots-explained-why-businesses-should-be-paying-attention-to-the-chatbot-revolution-2016-7) published an article about chatbots and mentioned Exponea among enabling technology. We indeed have integrated our marketing automation with Facebook Messenger API to enable chatbots but that's not what people want. They want a real chatbot. 

So we have built it, pardon - her. Her name is Joana and is a grand daughter of Elisa born in 1966. She has some skills of psychoterapist and arguing with her is a bit tricky ..
Have fun.
